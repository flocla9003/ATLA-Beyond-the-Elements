	<h1> Beyond the Elements: Earth Kingdom and Air Nomads</h1>

<h2>Earth Kingdom</h2>

<ul>
			<li> <strong> Currency:</strong> gold, silver, and copper pieces </li>
			<li> <strong> Government:</strong> Monarchy</li>

	<p>The Earth Kingdom is the largest of the world's four nations, taking almost an entire continent of today's modern map, as well as a few small pieces of land around the world.</br>
	Earthbending techniques are most closely based off of a Southern Chinese martial art called Hung Ga, which focuses on striking, strong stances and hand techniques. The Earth Kingdom is also 
	closely related to Chinese culture in general, with similar architecture, clothing and more. That being said, the Earth Kingdom is the largest nation in the Avatar Universe, and therefore has many diverse cultures.</p>

<h4>Earth Kingdom Characters</h4>

<h3>Toph Beifong</h3>
<img src="assets/Toph.png"
	alt="Toph Beifong"
	height="150"
	width="100">
<p> Toph Beifong is one of the most important characters in <em>Avatar:The Last Airbender.</em> The character is introduced in the episode titled: "The Swamp", where Aang sees her as a hallucination, and realizes she is meant to be his teacher. They meet for the first time during the Earth Rumble Tournaments, where the small and blind 12 year old defeats grown men that are twice her size. </br>
She is then shown as the sweet, quiet young daughter of the rich Beifongs, and because of her blindness, is treated carefully and ridiculously overprotected.</br> 
Toph joins Aang, Katara, and Sokka because Aang knows that she is meant to be his Earthbending teacher. </br>
Toph Beifong is stronger than anyone expected, and goes on to become one of the best Earthbenders in history. She uses her feet to feel the Earth and see the world around her. 
She is most notable for inventing the art of metalbending, something no Earthbender before her could manage to do.</br>
With this skill, she opens a school, "Toph Beifong's Metalbending Academy". She was able to recognize other metalbenders that needed guidance by using a seismic sense learned from the badgermoles. In the show, she even shares the guidance she received from the badgermoles, after consistently being belittled by the people around her due to her blindness. </p>


<h3>King Bumi</h3>
<img src="assets/Bumi.jpeg"
	alt="King Bumi"
	height="200"
	width="150">
<p> Bumi is the King of Omashu, a large city in the Earth Kingdom. He is wild and eccentric, but quite old. Before the war, and before Aang's disappearance, Bumi and Aang were great friends. They went on adventures together and caused a lot of light hearted chaos as kids. He grew up to be one of the most powerful benders in the Earth Kingdom. Aang and his old friend meet again later in the show, and Bumi plays some pranks on the Avatar. This is a heart-warming episode, as neither of them expected to see each other again. Viewers love their friendship and their importance to each other is shown in the next show, <em> The Legend of Korra</em> when it is revealed that Aang and Katara named their child Bumi, in honor of their old friend. </p> 
<h3>Suki</h3>
<img src="assets/Suki.png"
	alt="Suki"
	height="200"
	width="100">

<p> Suki is the leader of Kyoshi Warriors, a strong martial artist group of all women, named after Avatar Kyoshi. They live on Kyoshi Island, and are strongly female based. Kyoshi founded her island, and it is technically not part of the four nations, but is related to the Earth Kingdom. Suki goes on to play a big character in the show, and helps the Avatar team defeat Fire Lord Ozai with her martial arts skills, and her clever ideas. In the show, Suki and Sokka meet early on, and end up dating all the way through, and it is shown in <em> The Legend of Korra</em> and the continuing comics, that Suki and Sokka end up together in the end. </p>

<h3>Cabbage Merchant</h3>

	alt="Cabbage Merchant"
	height="200"
	width="100">

<p> The Cabbage Merchant is exactly what he sounds like. He is a reoccurring, funny character throughout the series and he wasn't supposed to be. He always has a cabbage stand that continuously gets ruined by Aang and his friends by accident. He became an iconic character in the fandom.</p>


<h2>Air Nomads </h2>
<ul>
			<li> <strong> Currency:</strong> yuan </li>
			<li> <strong> Government:</strong> No government
			<li> <strong> Ruler (During ATLA):</strong> Senior Monks and Nuns
			<li> <strong> Capital: </strong> None
			<li> <strong> Earthbending Instructor: </strong> Flying Bison
		</ul>
<img src="assets/bison.jpg"
	alt="badgermole"
	height="200"
	width="250"
	left:100px;> 
<p> The Air Nomads have four temples, Eastern, Western, Southern, and Northern Air Temples. All Air Nomads were peaceful, nature loving people, most being considered monks. They had no government, but they made unified decisions, and trusted the elders of their people. They focused on meditation and morals, always staying peaceful.
The Air Nomads learned air bending from flying bison, and at some point, they chose a bison of their own, which would be their partner for life.
</br> At the beginning of the war, the Fire Nation wanted to get rid of the Avatar, knowing that the next Avatar had to be an airbender because of the cycle, they decided to get rid of all airbenders. However they did not know that Aang had already run away. 
</br> Airbending is based off of a Baguazhang style of martial arts, called circle walking. Their culture is based very strongly on Buddhism, specifically Tibetan and Nepalese culture, as well as Shaolin Monks and Sri Lankan Buddhism. The Air Nomads also seem to be influenced by Hinduism.</p>

<h4>Air Nomad Characters</h4>

<h3> Aang</h3> 
<img src="assets/Avatar_Aang.png"
	alt="Aang"
	height="200"
	width="250"
	left:100px;> 

<p> Avatar Aang is the main character of the show, as he is the Avatar of the time period. He does not have the easiest life as the Avatar, because he is the last airbender alive, and he is 112 years old, meaning that Bumi is the only person that he knows that is still alive. Aang was told he was the Avatar at a very young age, and was pressured by his people to train for his Avatar duties, and ran away (with his flying bison, Appa) out of fear. After running away, he was caught in a storm and almost died, using the Avatar State to save himself and Appa by freezing them in an iceberg. A hundred years later, he is found by Katara and Sokka and begins mastering the elements to save the world. He gets a lot of hate through his journey because he "betrayed" the people by not stopping the war sooner, and allowing the fire nation to wipe out all of the airbenders. However, he works hard, builds new relationships, defeats Ozai, and restores peace between the four nations. Aang ends up with Katara, and their relationship is shown in the comics. <em> The Legend of Korra</em>, the show about the Avatar after Aang, that he and Katara get married and begin to rebuild the Airbender's culture.</p> 
<h3> Appa</h3> 
<img src="assets/appa.png"
	alt="Appa"
	height="250"
	width="200"
	left:100px;>
<p> Appa is Aang's flying bison that was frozen in the iceberg with him for 100 years. He was thought to be the last one, until the next series reveals that a group of firebenders were raising a herd of the the ones that were not killed in the genocide. The show would not have been possible without Appa, as he flew the group around the world to prepare for the final fight of the war (Aang against Ozai). While the show does not say much about the species, it is revealed that they "mate" with their airbending human for life and they average a height of about 12 feet. The flying bison are the original airbenders that taught the monks, and therefore have their own airbending tricks. Appa himself has a lot of personality, and a deep love for Aang. </p> 
<h3> Momo</h3>
<img src="assets/momo.png"
	alt="Momo"
	height="150"
	width="150"
	left:100px;> 
<p> Momo is a flying lemur that was found by Aang, Sokka, and Katara when they visited the Southern Air Temple. "Momo" means peach in Japanese, and Aang named him Momo after he stole a moon peach from Sokka. Aang and Momo have a strong bond, which many believe to be because Momo is Monk Gyatso reincarnated. He is the last known of his kind, however they do come across a species very similar to the flying lemur after the war. </p> 

<h3>Monk Gyatso</h3>
<img src="assets/gyatso.png"
	alt="Pakku"
	height="250"
	width="150">
<p> Monk Gyatso was an older monk from the Southern Air Temple that fathered Aang. He was Aang's main mentor and caretaker, and they were very very close. Gyatso was the only adult trying to keep the others from telling Aang he was the Avatar, because he believed that would be the right thing to do. Unfortunately, Monk Gyatso is killed in the genocide of the Air Temples, but it is believed that he and Aang were reconnected  becuase he was reincarnated as Momo. Aang looked up to Gyatso very much, and his way of life is a huge guide to the young Avatar throughout the show. </p>
