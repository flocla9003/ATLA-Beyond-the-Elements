<p>The Water Tribes are divided into two Tribes, Southern and Northern.Technically three, if you count the slight division of the Northern Tribe. The two tribes are very different, as all the men of the Southern Water Tribe left to fight in the Hundred Years War.</br>
They are small nations, compared to the Fire Nation and Earth Kingdom, but they are still very powerful.     
Due mostly to the war, the Southern Water Tribe was majorly struggling. The men were gone, and only one bender was left, with no bending teacher. The Southern Water Tribe also no longer practices the strict spiritual rules as the Northern Tribe. </br>
The Northern Water Tribe started off divided into many different tribes, but eventually came together as one. During the war, they became very isolated, and managed to stay a very sting nation, unlike the Southern Water Tribes. The culture of the tribe is different; women became eligible for marriage at 16, and were not allowed to learn waterbending for fighting purposes, only healing (until after the war).</br>
The two tribes' cultures are based on Arctic cultures like Inuit and Yupik, and the waterbending techniques are based off of Tai Chi.</p>

<h4>Water Tribe Characters</h4>

<h3>Katara</h3>
<img src="assets/katara.png"
	alt="Katara"
	height="300"
	width="100">
<p> Katara is one of the main characters in the show, with many important contributions. She and her brother, Sokka, find Aang in the iceberg, and she frees him using waterbending. She is the last waterbender of the Southern Water Tribe, and chooses to travel to the North Pole with Aang to become a master waterbender, as she has no teachers in her tribe. When traveling, she finds out that Aang is the Avatar and helps him to master the elements and save the world. 
<h3>Sokka</h3>
<img src="assets/sokka.png"
	alt="Sokka"
	height="160"
	width="150">
<p> Sokka is one of the first characters introduced in the series. He is the brother of Katara, so he is also from the Southern Water Tribe, but he is a nonbender. Despite being a nonbender, he is still a strong fighter, with his weapon of choice being a boomerang.</br>
He and Katara found Aang in the iceberg, and Sokka was very against interacting with him, and even more against leaving their tribe. He did not truly believe Katara could be a powerful waterbender, and did not trust Aang and his airbending. However, he begins to lighten up and help out a lot. His first girlfriend was Yue, the Northern Water Tribe Princess that became the moon, and the rest of his life was spent with the leader of the Kyoshi Warriors, Suki.</p>

<h3>Yue</h3>
<img src="assets/yue.png"
	alt="Yue"
	height="200"
	width="100">
<p> Yue is the fifteen year old princess of the Northern Water Tribe. Her character is very important to the Avatar Universe due to her connection to the moon. When she was born, she was very very sick, but because she was princess of the Northern Water Tribe, the Moon Spirit blessed her and she was saved. However, during the Siege of the North, Fire Nation kills Tui, and Yue nobly sacrifices her life back to the moon and saves the Moon Spirit. She is also, less importantly, Sokka's first girlfriend. </p>
<h3>Pakku</h3>
<img src="assets/pakku.png"
	alt="Pakku"
	height="250"
	width="150">
<p> Pakku is an absolute master of waterbending from the Northern Water Tribe. He has such power that he has been referred to as the best waterbender in the world. He is serious, sexist and harsh in the beginning, but becomes a calmer spirit and is an incredible teacher to Katara. He believes women should only learn waterbending to heal, until Katara changes his mind and becomes just as good, if not better, as him. It is also discovered that he was planning to marry Sokka and Katara's grandmother, Kanna. They later come back together and marry after the war.</p>
<h2> Fire Nation</h2>

	<ul>
			<li> <strong> Currency:</strong>ban/ Fire Nation Coins </li>
			<li> <strong> Government:</strong> Autocratic Absolute Monarchy</li>
			<li> <strong> Ruler (During ATLA):</strong> Fire Lord (Ozai)</li>
			<li> <strong> Capital: </strong> Capital City</li>
			<li> <strong> Original Firebending Masters: </strong>Dragons (Ran and Shaw) </li>
		</ul>

<img src="assets/Dragons.png"
	alt="Fire Nation Dragons"
	height="150"
	width="250">

<p> The art of firebending is based on Northern Shaolin Kung Fu. The Fire Nation is mostly inspired by Southeast Asian culture, as well as Japanese. This is mostly shown in their government and military, as well as clothing and architecture.</br>
 The Fire Nation is by far the strongest of the four, ruling most land in the world. They are ruled by the show's main antagonist, Fire Lord Ozai, and all firebenders are extremely powerful with some of the most deadly sub-bending abilities in the Avatar Universe.</br> 
Fire Lord Sozin is the main reason for the start of the war because he had a strong desire to expand the Fire Nation through the entire world, and decided to attack the Air Temples, knowing the next Avatar would be an Airbender, therefore giving him time to complete his plan, with no Avatar to stop him.  </p>

	height="150"
	width="150">
<p> Zuko is the sixteen year old prince of the Fire Nation and one of the absolute most important characters in the show. He is a very powerful firebender purely due to his anger and strong emotion. He was banished from the Fire Nation after speaking out against a general, and losing an Agni Kai with his father. Capturing the Avatar is his only chance to get his honor back, so he and his uncle, Iroh, live on a ship chasing Aang for months. Eventually, he comes to the realization that the Fire Nation is in the wrong and decides to join Aang's team and help defeat Ozai. After the war, he becomes Fire Lord, and begins to restore peace between the four nations, adjusting to the changes the war made.</p>

She is on the side of the Fire Nation throughout the entire war, and she consistently gets in Aang's way when trying to defeat Ozai. In the end, Azula fights Zuko and Katara, losing and ending up basically insane. </p>

Iroh was once a general of the Fire Nation and in line to be the next Fire Lord, but decided to step down after the tragic death of his son. He now sees Zuko as a son, and goes on to own his own tea shop after the war because he has a deep love for tea.
