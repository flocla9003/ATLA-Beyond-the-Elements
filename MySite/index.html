 <h1>Avatar:The Last Airbender</h1>

	<h2> Beyond the Elements</h2>

	<p> <em>Avatar:The Last Airbender</em> is a fantastic show from the early 2000s, about a different version of the world. In the Avatar Universe, the world has been split into four nations, each representing an element. This universe also has one Avatar, a master of all four elements, who is reborn into each nation after every lifetime. All is well in the world, until the fire nation attacks, and the Avatar disappears. The show takes place 100 years later, when Avatar Aang is found in an iceberg, long into the war when Fire Lord Ozai has destroyed all air nomads.The world had lost hope that the Avatar was still alive, until Aang, the last airbender left, rises to defeat Fire Lord Ozai.</p>

	<p> The show follows Aang, the Air Nomad Avatar, as well as siblings Katara and Sokka, from the Southern Water Tribe. There are
	also characters such as Prince Zuko, Uncle (former General) Iroh, and Princess Azula from the Fire Nation, and Toph from the Earth Kingdom. While the show provides a lot of information, this website will give you all the information you need to know about the four nations and their most important characters.</br>
